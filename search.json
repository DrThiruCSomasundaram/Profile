As a part and on-behalf of an international team called “International Community of Practice on Nutrient Composition of Aquatic Foods”, I organised all the logistics (Flights, Visas, Ground transport, Meals and snacks, Accommodation, Venue, Remote Connectivity, Reimbursements, Health and safety) necessary to conduct a successful writing workshop in Rome, Italy for 18 in-person and 4 remote participants. This workshop was funded by Lancaster Environment Center and supervised by Professor Christina Hicks.\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\nA year of resurrection and doctoral graduation\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2024 - December 2025\n\nCasual Research Fellow, Nutrition and Seafood Laboratory (NuSea.Lab), Deakin University (Deakin Marine) at Queenscliff, Victoria 3225, Australia. As a research fellow I was involved in experimental designs, sampling protocol preparation, and biochemical analysis of feeds and tissue sample arising from a coral husbandry experiment carried out in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Queensland, Australia. I also was involved in data engineering, data curation, scripting, data analysis and interpretation of the results of 3 experiments under this project.\n\n\n\n\n2020-2023\n\nAn academic in the making\n\n\n\n\nMay 2022 - December 2023\n\nFinal year Ph.D. Candidate, Life and Environmental Sciences, School of Engineering and Built Environment, Deakin University. I completed the last phase of my candidature at Nutrition and Seafood Laboratory (NuSea.Lab), Deakin University (Deakin Marine) at Queenscliff, Victoria 3225, Australia. As a Ph.D. Candidate I was involved in experimental designs, designing and validating protocols, sample collection, processing, and biochemical analysis of the processed and unprocesssed samples from three different experiments using a Phyllospora comosa (crayweed) macrophytes collected from Victoria, Australia. Further, I built machine learning predictive and classification models using experimental and simulated data. So far, I have completed three manuscripts that are published in journals Food Research International, Food Control, and Algal Research. Two more manuscripts arising from my Ph.D. results are currently being drafted."
