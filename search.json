As a part and on-behalf of an international team called “International Community of Practice on Nutrient Composition of Aquatic Foods”, I organised all the logistics (Flights, Visas, Ground transport, Meals and snacks, Accommodation, Venue, Remote Connectivity, Reimbursements, Health and safety) necessary to conduct a successful writing workshop in Rome, Italy for 18 in-person and 4 remote participants. This workshop was funded by Lancaster Environment Center and supervised by Professor Christina Hicks.\n\nProject cost ~ £ 30,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\nA year of doctoral graduation and collaborations\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 2024 - December 2025\n\nCasual Research Fellow, Nutrition and Seafood Laboratory (NuSea.Lab), Deakin University (Deakin Marine) at Queenscliff, Victoria 3225, Australia. As a research fellow I was involved in experimental designs, sampling protocol preparation, and biochemical analysis of feeds and tissue sample arising from a coral husbandry experiment carried out in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, Townsville, Queensland, Australia. I also was involved in data engineering, data curation, scripting, data analysis and interpretation of the results of 3 experiments under this project.\n\nProject cost ~ A$ 305,000\n\n\n\n\n\n2020-2023\n\nAn academic in the making\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2022 - December 2022\n\nResearch Consultant, Freelancer. I provided research consultation for an external research organization called Focus PVT LTD for an AgriFutures, Australia funded project on seaweed value addition for agricultural inputs along with the director Dr Jane Stanely. I directly contributed to the experimental design, execution of the field experiments, and writing one report and two fact sheets, one on regulatory reforms relating to seaweed use and the other one about practical farm use of seaweeds as outcomes of this project.\n\nProject cost ~ A$ 40,000\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 2020 - December 2023\n\nPh.D. Candidate, Life and Environmental Sciences, School of Engineering and Built Environment, Deakin University. I completed my candidature at Nutrition and Seafood Laboratory (NuSea.Lab), Deakin University (Deakin Marine) at Queenscliff, Victoria 3225, Australia. As a Ph.D. Candidate I was involved in experimental designs, designing and validating protocols, sample collection, processing, and biochemical analysis of the processed and unprocesssed samples from three different experiments using a Phyllospora comosa (crayweed) macrophytes collected from Victoria, Australia. Further, I built machine learning predictive and classification models using experimental and simulated data. So far, I have published three manuscripts with high impact Elsevier Journals including Food Research International, Food Control, and Algal Research. Two more manuscripts arising from my Ph.D. results are currently being drafted.\n\nProject cost ~ A$ 256,000\n\n\n\n\n\n2016-2019\n\nA national level independant scientist and a research manager\n\n\n\n\nDecembre 2016 - August 2019\n\nScientist, Post Harvest (Marine), National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency, Sri Lanka.
